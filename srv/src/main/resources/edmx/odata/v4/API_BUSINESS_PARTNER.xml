The structure defined in the case of the RFC does not permit another address to be transferred, so the standard address is used for incoming status notifications too.The SAP users have the addresses of their exchange P.O. boxes in their standard communication type 'Internet Mail' as the home address and their Internet address in the SAP system as their standard address. Example:Home address: Bernard.Brown@Company.comStandard address: Bernard.Brown@System.Company.comSending using an SMTP nodeThe home address of the communication type 'Internet Mail' (Bernard.Brown@Company.com) is used as the sender address.

An IBAN has a maximum of 34 alphanumeric characters and is a combination of the following elements:&#xA;&#xA;Country key of the bank (ISO code)Two-digit check numberCountry-specific account number (in Germany this consists of the bank number and account number, in France the bank number, account number and check key).The IBAN not only makes international payments easier, in some countries it has advantages for domestic payments as well. Depending on the country, it can mean advantages for value and fees.The IBAN can be maintained in parallel with the bank details but does not replace them. It is stored under the master data of the business partner and can then be used when creating the payment medium.Since it is only the bank that has the account that may generate the IBAN corresponding to an account number, the SAP system only generates a proposal. You can confirm or change this proposal. If no proposal is generated, enter the IBAN manually.An IBAN in Belgium may look like this:Electronic Form:BE62510007547061Printed form, as it would appear on an invoice:IBAN BE62 5100 0754 7061"/>

The relationship between this date and the dunning date does not affect how the account is processed.The printing of account movements in the legal dunning procedure differs from the normal printing of dunning notices as follows:You must specify a separate form for your dunning procedure in Customizing. For more information, see Customizing (IMG) under Dunning Forms.The dunning program also displays text element 520 &amp;quot;Legal dunning procedure&amp;quot;. This makes it possible to display the date of the legal dunning procedure from the master record.The program also displays the documents blocked for dunning and those with a payment method (automatic debit, bank direct debit).Although dunning notices are printed, the dunning level does not change in the master record or in the items. New dunning level = old dunning level.The program only updates the date of the last dunning run.Enter the date manually."/>
